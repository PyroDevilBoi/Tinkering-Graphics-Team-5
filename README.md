## Contract 3 by Adrian Tofan
Requires the following libraries: ``` pygame, sys, os, random ```
and also requires folders that contain specific .png images in order to work: **heads, bodies, arms, legs, background**.

The reason for choosing the *MIT* license is mainly because of its permissive conditions, the license only requiring preservation
of copyright and license notices.
